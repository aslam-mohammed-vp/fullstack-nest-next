### Running the app

Prerequisite:
npm/yarn and  mongoDB should be installed.
Create a DB with name 'nest-app'.

Once you have the folder and are ready to start, you can run `yarn` (or `npm install`) from the root directory to install dependencies. After that, you can run:

```bash
# npm
npm run start

# or yarn
yarn start
```

This will start the application in development mode.

If you face issue in starting the next dev server with error code 'ENOWORKSPACES' please run below command.


```bash
npx next telemetry disable
```

You can see the client application running in your browser by going to http://localhost:3000.

You can access the API documentation(Swagger) with below url:
